# _Pizza Order_

#### _Website allowing users to order a pizza based on size, crust and toppings, July 2016_

#### By _**Ashley Riehl**_

## Description

_This webpage contains a form that users fill out to order a pizza.  The webpage then stores the size, crust type, and toppings that the user selects into an array.  It uses all of these inputs to calculate the final cost of the pizza. Finally it outputs their order and the final cost into their "cart" on the webpage's sidebar._
